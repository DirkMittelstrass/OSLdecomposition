#' @title Identify and Separate Continuous-Wave Optically Stimulated Luminescence Signal Components
#'
#' @description Function library for the identification and separation of exponentially
#' decaying signal components in continuous-wave optically stimulated luminescence (CW-OSL) measurements.
#' A special emphasis is laid on luminescence dating with quartz, which is known for
#' systematic errors due to CW-OSL signal components with unequal physical behaviour.
#' This package enables an automatised workflow for signal component deconvolution
#' in combination with the R package 'Luminescence'.
