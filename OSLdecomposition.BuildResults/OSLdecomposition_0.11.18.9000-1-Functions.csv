"plot_PhotoCrosssections","Plot comparison of CW-OSL component photoionisation cross sections of different models","Function takes the  output.complex = TRUE  output of  fit_OSLcurve  and draws the photoionisation cross sections of different models in relation to each other. If a stimulation wavelength between 465 and 480 nm was chosen, the photoionisation cross sections are set into relation with literature values from Singarayer and Bailey (2003), Jain et al. (2003) and Durcan and Duller (2011).",NA,NA,NA,"Dirk Mittelstrass,  dirk.mittelstrass@luminescence.de <br /> <br /> Please cite the package the following way:<br /> <br /> Mittelstraß, D., Schmidt, C., Beyer, J., Heitmann, J. and Straessner, A.:<br /> Automated identification and separation of quartz CW-OSL signal components with R,  in preparation .<br />",NA
"RLum.OSL_correction","Check and correct CW-OSL curves in RLum.Analysis data sets","CW-OSL measurements are often affected by background signals or might be measured under inconsistent detection settings or have other issues.

"RLum.OSL_global_fitting","Identify CW-OSL signal components in RLum.Analysis data sets","First, all CW-OSL records are combined to one global average CW-OSL curve, then the multi-exponential fitting approach of Bluszcz and Adamiec (2006) is applied.

"sum_OSLcurves","Combine RLum OSL records to one global average curve","The function adds up CW-OSL records saved in  RLum.Analysis  objects and calculates the arithmetic mean signal from all records for each channel.
