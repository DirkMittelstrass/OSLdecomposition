## Results 

[Step 1](#basics) of a component-resolved dose calculation is the identification of the components occurring in the data set. 
Constant signal component decay rates $\lambda$ over all measurements were assumed and one global average CW-OSL curve was calculated. On this, a series of multi-exponential decay model fittings with an increasing number of components $K$ was performed. The resulting CW-OSL models can be compared by their photoionisation cross sections $\sigma$ and their fitting quality to select the best suiting set of signal components. See section [Methods](#Overview) for details.

### Photoionisation cross sections

Under the assumption that the provided optical stimulation parameters ($\lambda_{stim}=$ `r fit_data$parameters$stimulation.wavelength` $\mathrm{nm}, \Phi_{stim}=$ `r fit_data$parameters$stimulation.intensity` $\mathrm{\frac{mW}{cm^2}}$) were correct, the found decay rates were translated into [photoionisation cross section values](#M3) and set into relation with quartz OSL literature values:

```{r step1_draw_crosssections_diagram, fig.width=10, fig.asp=0.32}

#cross.plot.height <- 0
#if ((stimulation_wavelength >= 465) && (stimulation_wavelength <= 480)) cross.plot.height <- 3
#cross.plot.height <- (cross.plot.height + 2 + K.selected) * 0.01
#knitr::opts_current$set(fig.asp = cross.plot.height)

if (!is.null(image_format)) image_file <- paste0(image_path, "step1_fig2_cross-sections.", image_format)

plot_PhotoCrosssections(fit_data,
                        stimulation.intensity = fit_data$parameters$stimulation.intensity,
                        stimulation.wavelength = fit_data$parameters$stimulation.wavelength,
                        filename = image_file)

# <font color=\"black\"> </font>

  cat("<br><i><b>Figure 2:</b> Photoionisation cross section comparison assuming a stimulation light intensity of", fit_data$parameters$stimulation.intensity, "mW/cm² and a stimulation light wavelength of", fit_data$parameters$stimulation.wavelength,"nm.</i><br><br>")
```

Systematic shifts in the photoionisation cross sections are likely when compared to literature values. These are caused by false estimates of the effective stimulation intensity. To manually correct for these shifts, apply the following rules when setting `RLum.OSL_global_fitting(stimulation_intensity = ?)`:

* <b>Increase</b> stimulation intensity to shift the cross sections towards <b>right</b>
* <b>Decrease</b> stimulation intensity to shift the cross sections towards <b>left</b>

### Component number selection

Selecting those fitting model with the physically correct number of components $K$ is not trivial. According to [Bailey et al. (1997)](#ref), [Mittelstraß (2019)](#ref) and others, are most quartz samples  sufficiently described by three CW-OSL components. Thus, the $K = 3$ fitting is chosen as default model. However, additional OSL components might give a significant signal contribution and might make the $K = 3$ model insufficient. Or in a measurement are just two components apparent. Therefore, an $F$-test is performed like suggested by [Bluszcz & Adamiec (2006)](#ref). The test criterion $F_K$ measures the improvement in the fitting quality by an additional component, see section [F-test](#M4) for details. Falls $F_K$ below the preset value of *F*~threshold~ =  `r fit_data$parameters$F.threshold`, the model with $(K-1)$-components is selected as best model. 


```{r step1_fitting_table}

F_table <- fit_data$F.test.print
row_index <- c(1:nrow(F_table))
F_table <- cbind(data.frame(K = row_index), F_table)

# if (fit_data$parameters$background.fitting == TRUE) {
# colnames(F_table) <- c("  $K$  ", paste0("$\\lambda_", row_index,"$ $(s^{-1})$"), "background", "RSS", "$F_K$")

# Default model with K = 3
K.default <- 3
K.default.text <- "<u>Green stripe</u>: Default CW-OSL model for quartz."
if (fit_data$K.selected < 4) {
  
  K.default <- fit_data$K.selected
  K.default.text <- ""}

colnames(F_table) <- c("  $K$  ", paste0("$\\lambda_", row_index,"$ $(s^{-1})$"), "$RSS$","$F_K$")

# Table caption:
cat(paste0("<br><i><b>Table 2:</b> Decay rates and fitting quality parameters in dependence of component number $K$. <br>$RSS$: Residual square sum. $F_K$:  Measure of fitting improvement.</i><br>", K.default.text, " <u>Blue stripe</u>: F-test selected model.<br>"))

# print F-test table
kable(F_table, escape = TRUE, align = "c") %>% 
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("condensed")) %>%  # "striped", 
  row_spec(K.default, background = "lightgreen") %>%
  row_spec(fit_data$K.selected, background = "lightblue")
```

```{r eval=FALSE, include=FALSE}

### Signal bin overdispersion idea

# List of model selection helps:
# 1. Comparision of the photoionisation cross section with literature values
# 2. Evaluation of the fitting quality by an F-test and the *reduced Chi²*
# 3. (ToDo:) Evaluation of the decomposition quality by signal bin overdispersion

# The idea is the following: Incorrect decay rates lead to lopsided residual curves over the signal bin intervals in the decomposition process. These lopsided residuals can be detected by taking the signal bin variance in relation to the poisson distribution variance. The result is a kind of "overdispersion" value for each signal bin in each OSL record. The K = ? model where the median of these overdispersions is minimal, should be the best suiting model for the majority of CW-OSL curves

### Basics {#basics}

The data analysis approach assumes that all CW-OSL signal curves in a data set can be sufficently described by a sum of exponential decays with first order kinetics:

$$I(t) = \sum_{i=1}^K n_ie^{-\lambda_it}$$

Here, $I(t)$ is the CW-OSL signal, $K$ is the number of signal components. Each component is defined by its intensity $n$ and its decay rate $\lambda$.  

To achieve component-seperated dose information, the data analysis process is divided into multiple steps:

### Step 1 workflow {#Overview}

This report covers the Step 1 analysis, which can be outlined as following:

<center>

![](details_Step1.png)
</center>

Detailed explanations on step 1.1 and step 1.2 can be found in [Mittelstraß (2019)](#ref). Practical advice can be found in the *R* documentations `?sum_OSLcurves` and `?fit_OSLcurve`.

Step 1.2 is based on the ideas of [Bluszcz & Adamiec (2006)](#ref). The differential evolution (see [Price et al. 2006](#ref)) was performed by the function `DEoptim` from the package `DEoptim` [(Ardia et al. 2020)](#ref) and deployed `decompose_OSLcurve` (see Step2) for the calculation of the linear parameters. The Levenberg-Marquardt fitting was performed by the function `nlsLM` from the package `minpack.lm` [(Elzhov et al. 2016)](#ref).


### Photoionisation cross sections {#M3}

The signal decay rate $\lambda_{k}$ of each component is translated into the photoionisation cross section $\sigma_{k}$ of the associated defect state by: 

$$\sigma_{k}=\lambda_{k} {hc \over \Phi_{stim}\lambda_{stim}}$$
Here, $h$ is the Planck constant, $c$ is the speed of light, $\Phi_{stim}$ is the stimulation light intensity and $\lambda_{stim}$ is the stimulation light wavelength. If this wavelength is about ~ 470 nm and the measured sample material is quartz, then the resulting photoionisation cross sections can be compared with literature values, see figure 2. For the automatic assignement of component names, an approximated 2-$\sigma$ bandwidth of the average literature value was used, see `?fit_OSLcurve` the exact definition.

**Important note:** The stimulation light intensity, displayed by OSL/TL reader control software, might differ from the effective stimulation light intensity. Degrading of stimulation LED, /lasers and filters as well as a dirty chamber window can significantly decrease the light output. In addition, the light flux in the bulk material depends on the reflectance and transmittance of the sample, its fixation and the sample carrier. Systematic shifts in the photoionisation cross section values are therefore likely.


### F-test {#M4}

[Bluszcz & Adamiec (2006)](#ref) proposed the use of an *F*-test to compare CW-OSL models by their fitting quality. The test criterion $F_K$ measures the improvement caused by an additional component. It compares the residual square sum (*RSS*) of the $K-1$ model with the new $K$ model:

$$F_K = \frac{(RSS_{K-1} - RSS_K)/2}{RSS_K(N - 2K)} $$

Here, $N$ is the number data points (channels) of the global average curve and $K$ is the number of OSL components in the fitting model. If $F_K$ falls below a preset threshold value (Here, $F_{threshold}$ = `r fit_data$parameters$F.threshold`), the new fitting model with one additional component is apparently not significantly better than the *K* - 1 model.

However, components with not-first-order kinetics, variations in the decay rates and too long measurement duration can lead to the detection of imaginary signal components, as [Mittelstraß (2019)](#ref) discussed in more detail. Therefore, the F-test outcome should be taken with care. Regarding the parameter of $F_{threshold}$, is the ideal value data set dependent. [Mittelstraß (2019)](#ref) showed that reasonable settings are in the range of: $50 < F_{threshold} < 300$
