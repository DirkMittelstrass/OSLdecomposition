## OSLdecomposition `devel`

- The component decomposition failed with the upcoming release of the package `Luminescence`
due to changes in the record type naming scheme; fixed (#1285; @mcol)

## OSLdecomposition `1.1.0` (`r Sys.Date()`)

-   The package has now a DOI: [doi.org/10.32614/CRAN.package.OSLdecomposition](https://doi.org/10.32614/CRAN.package.OSLdecomposition).
-   Added more general plot function: `plot_MultiExponential()`
-   Reworked `plot_OSLcurve()` to be just a wrapper function for `plot_MultiExponential()`, which makes it more robust.
-   Changed graph style in `plot_OSLcurve()` to stacked areas. Also changed default colors.
-   Add module tests and automatically generated HTML test reports. Currently only for `plot_MultiExponential()`, `plot_OSLcurve()` and `decompose_OSLcurve()`.
-   Solved bug in `RLum.OSL_correction()` that `remove_light_off` algorithm may throw warnings or errors for specific curves
-   RLum.OSL functions return now helpful error messages if BIN or XSYG data objects are used as input without the transforming them into RLum.Analysis objects beforehand.
-   `decompose_OSLcurve()` uses now element names of named lambda vector as component names.
-   Fixed some issues and errors in the roxygen documentation.
-   Bumped version requirements to R \>= 4.3 and Luminescence \>= 1.1.0.
-   Adding `'knitr'` to suggest and fix CRAN Rd note .
-   Fix `Lost braces`.
